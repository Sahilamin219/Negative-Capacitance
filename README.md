# Negative-Capacitance

We present a SPICE model for ferroelectric transistors (FEFETs) based on time-dependent Landau-Khalatnikov equation solved self-consistently with the transistor equations. The model also considers depolarization fields due to non-ideal contacts. We experimentally characterize FE films to calibrate our model, based on which we analyze the device and circuit implications of FEFETs. We discuss the dependence of the ON current and gate capacitance of FEFETs on the FE thickness and FE material parameters. A ring oscillator analysis shows delay reduction up to 97% at iso-energy for FEFETs compared with MOSFETs at VDD <0.4 V. FEFET-based SRAMs show 47%-68% larger read stability and 50%-57% lower access time, albeit with an increase in the write time.
